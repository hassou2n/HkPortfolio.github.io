                  <h3>Web Design</h3>
                  <p>
                    Is the process of creating visually appealing and functional
                    websites. This involves planning and designing the layout,
                    user interface, and overall look and feel of the website.
                    The goal of web design is to create a website that is easy
                    to navigate and use, while also communicating the intended
                    message to the audience.
                  </p>

                  <LearnMore>
                    Web design involves several key elements, including layout,
                    color scheme, typography, and graphics. The layout is the
                    arrangement of the various elements on the webpage, such as
                    text, images, and navigation menus. The color scheme refers
                    to the colors used on the website, which can impact the mood
                    and tone of the website. Typography involves selecting the
                    fonts and text sizes for the various elements on the
                    webpage, while graphics include images, videos, and other
                    visual elements. Web designers use a variety of tools and
                    technologies to create websites, including HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript. They may also use design software such as Adobe
                    Photoshop or Sketch to create visual mockups of the website
                    before it is built. Good web design is essential for
                    creating a successful online presence, as it can impact
                    factors such as user engagement, search engine optimization,
                    and brand recognition.

                  <h3>Web Development</h3>
                  <p>
                    Is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web
                    applications. It involves several different aspects,
                    including web design, front-end development, back-end
                    development, and web server administration. Web design
                    involves the planning and creation of the layout, interface,
                    and overall appearance of a website.
                  </p>
                  <LearnMore>
                    Front-end development focuses on the coding and
                    implementation of the design using technologies such as
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development involves the
                    programming of the server-side components of a website,
                    including databases and server-side scripting languages such
                    as PHP or Python. Web server administration involves the
                    configuration and management of the web server
                    infrastructure that serves and hosts the website. Web
                    developers use a wide range of tools and technologies to
                    create websites and web applications, including development
                    frameworks, content management systems (CMS), and
                    server-side languages. Some popular web development
                    frameworks include Angular, React, and Vue.js. CMS systems
                    like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal are widely used to build
                    content-driven websites. Web development is crucial for
                    creating effective, functional, and scalable websites and
                    applications. It plays a vital role in the growth of online
                    businesses, digital marketing, and e-commerce. A skilled web
                    developer must be proficient in multiple programming
                    languages, software development tools, and have a deep
                    understanding of web design and user experience principles.

                            High school typically refers to the final four years
                            of secondary education in the Iraq, usually attended
                            by students aged 14-18 years old. In high school,
                            students study a range of subjects including math,
                            science, English, social studies, and electives such
                            as art, music, or foreign languages. High school
                            education is compulsory in most states in the Iraq
                            and typically leads to a high school diploma, which
                            is necessary for pursuing further education or
                            finding employment. In addition to academic studies,
                            high school also provides opportunities for
                            extracurricular activities such as sports, clubs,
                            and community service.
